    Random Isometric Blocks
    -----------------------

    I love looking at those geometric grid-based images that the procedural art and
    graphic design crowd like to post on the internet. Many are isometric in nature, 
    so tend to be created by applying simple hexagonal grid trickery - usually 
    flipping some cleverly designed tiles in a random - or calculated - way.

    In order to produce one, all you need to do is convert screen coordinates to a 
    hexagonal grid coordinate with corresponding cell ID, then use your imagination... 
    or if you're like me and you don't have one, just reference one of the countless 
    patterns on the internet. :D

    Anyway, here's a simple example that I'm sure most have seen around. I'll put up a 
    more interesting one that involves interlacing next. Hopefully, some people on
    Shadertoy will post others.

    By the way, if you're not quite familiar with hexagonal grids, I've produced a 
    basic example to accompany this. The link is below.

// Leave some cube faces solid - Abje's suggestion. I like it because it breaks things
// up a bit.
//#define SOME_SOLID 

// Helper vector. If you're doing anything that involves regular triangles or hexagons, the
// 30-60-90 triangle will be involved in some way, which has sides of 1, sqrt(3) and 2.

// Standard vec2 to float hash - Based on IQ's original.

// Standard 2D rotation formula.
mat2 r2(in float a){ float c = cos(a), s = sin(a); return mat2(c, -s, s, c); }

// A diamond of sorts - Stretched in a way so as to match the dimensions of a
// cube face in an isometric scene.
float isoDiamond(in vec2 p){
    
    p = abs(p);
