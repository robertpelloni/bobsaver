    Triangle Mesh With Incircles
    ----------------------------

    Applying some mild adaptions to Tomkh's random triangulation algorithm to create a 
    haphazard triangular mesh with some inscribed packed circles.

    I'd made a few half-hearted attempts to put together a geometric Delaunay triangulation in
    shader form, but for some reason the lack of random pixel access was throwing me off. Anyway, 
    I made a side comment regarding my desire to see one on Shadertoy, and Tomkh posted a really
    cool looking and clever example almost immediately afterward, which pleased me no end. :)
    If you haven't seen it, I've provided a link below.

    This shader is just a variation of the original. I wrote it from scratch, but based it on 
    the logic from Tomkh's example. I expanded the 2x2 grid count to 3x3, in order to enable 
    the grid vertices to move further away from their original positions. In addition, I've 
    taken a polygon hit approach. Basically, I've iterated through all possible contributing 
    quadrilaterals within the pixel area, determined the specific triangle, then effectively 
    broken from the loop and returned its three vertices and unique identifier.

    The beauty of having access to the triangle vertices and ID in screen space is that you can
    render anything you want using normal vector rendering techniques. It's also pretty easy
    to render inscribed circles, circumscribed circles, etc. With more work, and provided you
    have a Delaunay triangulation, Voronoi edge lists are possible, and you can do some really
    cool things with those.

    Note that I haven't called this a Delaunay triangulation. Tohkh's example puts a restriction
    on the grid vertex movement, whereas I've allowed them to move more, which might break the 
    algorithm -- I have a feeling that additional neighboring checks might be necessary, but I 
    can't be sure. That's a question for someone else to answer, but either way, I'm going to 
    attempt to construct a dual Voronoi edge-list version next, so I'll find out soon enough... 
    unless Tomkh wants to do that too. :D

    For anyone interested, I've provided a bunch of "define" directives below. For instance,
    there are defines that'll exclude the background mesh and incircles for anyone who wants
    to study the mesh without the visual clutter. There's also a few different palette choices.

    Based on:

    // I'd been wanting to see a geometric Delaunay triangulation example on Shadertoy for ages,
    // so Tomkh (Tomasz Dobrowolski) was kind enough to whip one up in virtually no time. In
    // addition to helping me out, I really like the way this is presented.

    Another example:
    
    // Really nice screensaver-like example. To my knowledge, Mattz was the first to put up a 
    // quasi-randomized 2D triangle mesh. However, his particular example uses the same diagonal
    // orientation on each quadrilateral.
