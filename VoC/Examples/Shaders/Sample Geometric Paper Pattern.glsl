    Geometric Paper Pattern
    -----------------------

    A geometric pattern rendered onto some animated hanging paper, which for some 
    inexplicable and physics defying reason is also animated. :D

    I put this together out of sheer boredom, and I didn't spend a lot of time on 
    it, so I wouldn't look too much into the inner workings, especially not the 
    physics aspects... I honestly couldn't tell you why the paper is waving around 
    like that. :)

    The pattern is about as basic as it gets. I've used some equally basic post
    processing to give it a slightly hand drawn look. The pencil algorithm I've
    used is just a few lines, and is based on one of Flockaroo's more sophisticated
    examples. The link is below, for anyone interested. At some stage, I'd like
    to put a sketch algorithm out that is more hatch-like.

    On a side note, for anyone who likes small functions, feel free to take a look 
    at the "n2D" value noise function. I wrote it ages ago (also when I was bored) 
    and have taken it as far as I can take it. However, I've often wondered whether 
    some clever soul out there could write a more compact one.
