    Poincare Disc Animation
    -----------------------
    
    A CSG polygon driven Poincare tiling with an animated pattern overlay.
    
    This simple animation has been sitting around in my account for way too
    long. I made it at the same time as one of my other hyperbolic related 
    postings. There are not a great deal of animated Poincare disc examples
    around, so I wanted to make one. Like so many things I put together, it 
    was coded up without putting a great deal of thought into it. On a 
    personal level, I don't like producing code that involves "magic" numbers 
    and guesswork. However, there's a little bit of that in here. I'd imagine 
    experts in this area will probably roll their eyes at the sheer hackory 
    involved. :)
    
    In fact, I'm secretly hoping someone will see this and post an example 
    that shows me a better way to do it... Whilst I'm putting in requests, 
    one of those colored interwoven ribbon demonstrations on a Poincare disc
    would be nice. :) 
    
    In regard to the pattern itself, that was fairly easy. Rendering lines,
    points, etc., on a hyperbolic plane is similar to that on a Euclidean
    plane. However, you're using a coordinate system akin to polar coordinates,
    which is fine, unless it's been a while and you try to position things
    with Euclidean coordinates. In fact, the code up to that point is pretty 
    reliable. However, I really hacked around to render the arcs between side
    midpoints, and to render the repeat animation objects, so I was left 
    thinking that there'd have to be a more elegant way to do this.
    
    Anyway, the purpose of this was to post something artistic rather than a 
    treatise on hyperbolic geometry, for which there are already plenty of 
    interesting examples on here. The next step would be to post some cool 
    looking hyperbolic patterns using more realiable code. :)
